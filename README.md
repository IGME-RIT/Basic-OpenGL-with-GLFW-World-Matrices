# Basic OpenGL with GLFW: Index Buffers

This program introduces basic concepts involved in writing an OpenGL program.

# About

Multiplying a position by a World Matrix transforms the position from 'local space' to 'world space'.
This example builds structure on top of previous examples and abstracts some of rendering code.

# Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.
In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor.
Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
